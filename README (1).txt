Pomodoro Study Planner â€“ Submission Notes
Name: Tran Minh Tu
Submission: CAB302 Week 9 Prototype

Project Summary:
This is a JavaFX-based application to help students apply the Pomodoro Technique to study smarter. It includes:
- Pomodoro timer (Start / Stop / Reset)
- Task creation with duration input
- Task list with delete function
- Data persistence using SQLite via JDBC
- Simple JavaFX UI

Solo Development:
I tried to contact my teammates, but received no replies. I decided to complete the project individually.

Version Control:
As I was working alone, I did not use GitHub extensively during early development. Instead, I tracked tasks using a local checklist and saved progress manually. I will use Git and branching in upcoming stages.

Testing:
Includes a basic JUnit test case in TaskDAOTest.java to verify database operations.

This submission includes:
- Functional prototype
- SQLite database file
- All source code (OOP structure)
- Wireframe sketch
- Agile project folder ( sprint plan, user stories, Wireframe )

Planned Features for Future Weeks (e.g., Week 13):
------------------------------------------------------------
- User authentication: allow multiple users to log in and manage separate task data.
- AI study tips: give personalized suggestions based on task patterns using GPT or local API.
- Progress tracking: show charts of completed study sessions and productivity over time.
- Custom Pomodoro settings: let users change timer durations for focus, short, and long breaks.
- Notifications: alert users when it's time to start or end a Pomodoro session.
- UI enhancements: add light/dark mode and priority-based task colors.
- Task completion status: allow users to tick completed tasks and store completed history linked to their account.
